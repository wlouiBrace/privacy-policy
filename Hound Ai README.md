Hound Ai desktop voice assistant description (project description)
A desktop voice assistant application is a software program that allows users to control their computers using voice commands.
Desktop voice assistants can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as opening and closing applications, searching for information on the web, controlling media playback,
and interacting with smart home devices.

Desktop voice assistants typically work by listening to the user's voice and using natural language processing (NLP) to understand the user's commands.
Once the voice assistant has understood the user's command, it can execute the appropriate action.

Desktop voice assistants can be a valuable tool for users who want to be able to control their computers without using a keyboard and mouse.
